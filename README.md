Workloads, scripts, docker environment, and Batsim patches necessary to recreate simulation results presented in the FTXS 2021 paper entitled "Statistical Framework for Two-Party Acceptance Testing of HPC Systems for Reliability"

make sure git is installed as well as docker and that they are working correctly<br>
then type<br>
`git clone https://github.com/sc-2021-ccu-lanl-statistics/simulation-project.git`<br>
`cd simulation-project`<br>

Note: Info about actual cluster version and associated scripts is detailed near
the bottom of this document in the section "Execution Environment"

```
To run a single simulation, execute the following commands:

    docker build . -t simulation
    docker create --name test_suite -t simulation
    docker start test_suite
    docker exec -it test_suite /bin/bash
    python3 run_simulation.py --config 1_simulation.config --output /home/sim/experiments/1_sim
    
This runs a simulation based on Workload2, WL2.csv.  It runs 2
simulations; both with 1490 nodes and 30,000 simulated jobs.  The
first simulation is a baseline simulation with a system mean time
between failure of 24 hours (i.e. a failure rate lambda_good =
1/24).  The second simulation is 5x worse (lambda_bad = 5*lambda_good).
This would correspond to Table 4 of the paper, row 2, column 3.

After the simulation, at the very bottom is the normalized makespan,
which is what is presented in Table 4 of the paper. In this case,
Table 4 shows 1.319.  This means that the makespan of the 5x less
reliable system is around 31.9% worse compared to the baseline
system.

You will likely obtain a result that isn't exactly 1.319 (or
necessarily even close) since the failures are random across nodes
and time, as described in the paper. Due to this, we treated this
as a Monte Carlo simulation.  The results presented in the paper
in Table 4 are averaged across 1500 runs to determine the average
makespan for the baseline system, and also an additional 1500 runs
to determine the average makespan for the less reliable system for
a given workload.  Using these two averages we compute the average
normalized makespans for each of the scenarios presented in Table
4 of the paper, as the ratios of the average makespans for the less
reliable systems to the average makespans for the given baseline
systems. To exactly reproduce all of Table 4, please see the section
below "Reproducing Table 4 Exactly".

To run the simulation again you must specify a different
output folder.

    python3 run_simulation.py --output ~/experiments/___folder_name___

To use different parameters you must specify a different
config file

    python3 run_simulation.py --config sample.config --output ~/experiments/___folder_name___
    
The config file has several moving parts, but for our purposes here,
we will highlight a couple things you can do.  We will start by
addressing the config file that is in ~/basefiles/ Notice it starts
with the name of the overall experiment, "test". Most sweeps over
parameters have 3 ways of being performed:

as values in a list:             "range":[1,2,3]                       This chooses one value in the list after the other 

as a range with min,max,step:    "min":1,"max":3,"step":1              This starts at min, ends at max (inclusive)
                                                                      and increases or decreases by step each time

as the "formula"                 "formula":"1 * i","range":[500,600]  trivial example as i is only multiplied by one.
combined with both of the                                             But the idea is that you can use a variable "i" 
above methods                                                         that the range or min/max/step replaces it with
 

1_simulation.config 
 
{"test":{
             "input": {
                                                            
                    "node-sweep":{
                              "range":[1490]
                    },
                    "SMTBF-sweep":{
                                   "compute-SMTBF-from-NMTBF":true, 
                                   "formula":"128736000 * (1/i)", "range":[1,5]
                      },
                      "checkpoint-sweep":{
                                    "range":["optimal"]
                       },
                      "performance-sweep":{
                                    "range":[1.0]
                       },
                      "checkpointing-on":true, "seed-failures":true, 
                      "synthetic-workload":{
                        "number-of-jobs":30000,
                                                               
                        "number-of-resources":"/home/sim/basefiles/workload_types/wl2.csv:0:csv", 
                        "duration-time":"/home/sim/basefiles/workload_types/wl2.csv:1:h:csv", 
                        "submission-time":"0:fixed", 
                        "wallclock-limit":-1, "dump-time":"3%", 
                        "read-time":"2%"
                      }
                },
              "output": {
                        "AAE":true, "avg-makespan":1
              }
    }
 }


We do not cover every option here, but three typical parameters
include the SMTBF-sweep, the workload, as well as the output.

SMTBF
-----
It starts out saying our formula is based on a node mean time between
failure, not a system mean time between failure.  So it must compute
the system mean time between failure. Next, the node mean time
between failure is in seconds, so this is 1490 nodes * 24
hr.*3600seconds/hr  And we want the baseline(1) and 5x worse failures
(5).  If you want to find out the same information as before but
with, say 2x worse failures just change the "range":[1,5] to
"range":[1,2]  .  run_simulation does some stuff automatically, so
it is expecting baseline ("range":[1] ) to be first in the list.

Workload
---------
If you want to compare and contrast the impact of using different
workloads, edit the "number-of-resources" and "duration-time" file
to use, say wl3.csv instead.  It is currently at wl2.csv.  You may
want to change the number of jobs used (pulled) from each workload
to accommodate the different types of workloads.  For example: a
workload that is full of primarily small, short jobs will need more
jobs in a given simulation.

These are the numbers we use for amount of jobs:

wl1 50,000
wl2 30,000
wl3  5,000
wl4  3,000
wl5  1,000
wl6    500


Output
--------
AAE is the Average Application Efficiency.  This metric is not
used/addressed in this paper submission but was of interest to us
for studying the impact of checkpointing intervals, dump times and
restart times. It is also produced after every simulation.  The
avg-makespan, on the other hand, controls how many runs of each to
do.  We would recommend at least 20, but keep in mind we performed
1500 runs in order to ensure that our averages converged.


Running With New Parameters
-----------------------------

After making the above changes to the included 1_simulation.config
file, make sure you have the file in correct json (commas,colons,braces,
etc...) and save as another file.  So for example, to keep everything
the same except the avg-makespan (lets bump it to 20) then save as
20_simulation.config and run it using:

    python3 run_simulation.py --config 20_simulation.config --output ~/experiments/20_simulation
    
Reproducing Table 4 Exactly
----------------------------

In order to reproduce all of results in Table 4 with the same level
of fidelity as presented in the paper, 54K Batsim simulations are 
required. (6 workloads x 6 failure rates x 1500 runs per scenario)
On system #1 (described below) a single run averages around 4 minutes,
with a wide variation in timing depending on the input workload.
While we ran this parameter sweep in a moderately sized cluster, the
following command would reproduce Table 4 with a high degree of fidelity
in the non parallelized Docker provided:

    python3 run_simulation_table.py --config table_simulation.config  --output ~/experiments/table
    
A single run of all that is in the table is provided to see how the output would look

    python3 run_simulation_table.py --config 1_table_simulation.config --output ~/experiments/table_1

Experimentally Determined False Pass Rates
---------------------------------------------

In the paper, on page 8, second column, first full paragraph below
Table 4 (starting on line 890), we address the false pass rate using 
simulation to determine if we see the same rates predicted by the 
analytic analysis in Section 3 of the paper.  To produce these
results, we ran 20K Batsim simulations. These results can be reproduced
by using the following command:

For a 2x failure rate system 

    python3 run_pass_fail.py --config pass_fail_2x_20000.config --output ~/experiments/pf2

For a 5x failure rate system

    python3 run_pass_fail.py --config pass_fail_5x_20000.config --output ~/experiments/pf5
    
An example with 40 runs can be evaluated with the 2x and 5x commands, respectively.

    python3 run_pass_fail.py --config pass_fail_2x.config --output ~/experiments/pf2_40
    python3 run_pass_fail.py --config pass_fail_5x.config --output ~/experiments/pf5_40


Execution Environment 
-------------------------

For the results presented in our paper, we made use of a moderate
number of cluster resources to help speedup our parameter sweeps,
especially in light of the number of trials (1500) that we performed
per input parameter set.  

The actual cluster environment can be found in the file:

    ./monte_carlo/cluster_environment.txt

The job submission scripts and post-processing files that we used 
can also be found in the folder:

    ./monte_carlo

These two READMEs would be useful for deploying our scripts on
your own cluster:

    ./monte_carlo/README_FILES.txt -- a description of what each script does
    ./monte_carlo/README_HOW_TO_RUN.txt -- how to deploy 

NOTE: To get these scripts to run on your own system may require
some changes according to your own environment.

DOCKER VERSION:

To ease the reproducibility of our work,
we've containerized our work here using Docker (as mentioned above),
however there is no explicit parallelism in the containerized version
of our work.  Consequently, we would expect that to fully reproduce
our results using this container would likely take quite a long
time.

We tested this containerized version of our work on the following
systems:

1.  MacBookPro running OSX 10.15.7, 32GB RAM, 2.9GHz 6-core Intel
Core i9, Docker version 20.10.5 build 55c4c88, Darwin Kernel Version
19.6.0: root:xnu-6153.141.16~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64

2. Asus Prime Z370-A, Linux, 32GB RAM, 3.6GHz 6-core Intel Core i5,
Docker version 19.03.15 build 99e3ed89195c, OpenSuse Leap 15.2,
